The emotional arousal and pleasure during music listening is a widely observed phenomenon but the mechanism behind it remained unsolved for many years. We propose that the emotional effect of a song is relevant to the information it carries. In particular, a balance between pattern repeating and breaking should be achieved for a song to bring pleasure feeling, which means that either no information or information overload are un-preferred extremes, although the optimal position between these two extremes may vary between different audience. In the current study we use networks to represent the structure of songs. In these networks nodes are repeated patterns and edges are time intervals between them. We analyze the hierarchy of these networks and propose a novel index *N* to quantify the novelty (symmetry-breaking) of songs. This metric is a fingerprint for personal taste of audience across music genres and thus is an important feature to be considered in personalized music recommendation.
